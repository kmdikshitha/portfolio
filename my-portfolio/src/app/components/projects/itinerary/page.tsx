        I didn’t realize how deeply I was drawn to Product Development until I truly got exposed to it. Once I understood what Product Managers actually do—solving user problems through design, research, strategy, and tech—it sparked something in me.

        That simple question led to this passion project—my first attempt to put all the PM skills I’d been learning into action in one place.

      <p className="mb-4">
        This wasn’t a coding-heavy project. It was a PM-driven case study that helped me think across the full product lifecycle—from understanding the user to defining the MVP to thinking about how we measure success. Here's what I focused on:

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Outlined core features that solve a specific need: collaborative, editable itineraries.</li>
